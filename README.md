# Numpy-DL
This is a library I wrote when I was in my last year of undergrad as a way of studying Deep Learning. The most common models are included(Multi Layer Perceptron, RBMs, Autoencoders. DBN and some Recurrent Networks) are implemented using Numpy.

Note: The code hasn't been mantained in a lot of time and suffers from code rot. I really don't know what works and what doesn't.
