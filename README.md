# ToyDL-Library
This is was the library I wrote when I was in my last year of undergrad as a way of studying Deep Learning. The most common models (Multi Layer Perceptron, RBMs, Autoencoders. DBN and some Recurrent Networks).

There are exampels for all of them using the MNIST dataset.

Note: The code hasn't been mantained in a lot of time and suffers from code rot. I really don't know what works and what doesn't.
